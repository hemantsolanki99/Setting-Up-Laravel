# Setting-Up-Laravel
A Basic instructions to set up Laravel in Linux

When we start project laravel in linux environment then many problems occurs.
One of them is setting up the laravel and start using it xampp or lampp.

There occurs a problem mainly after we successfully created a project, but when we open it in browser, their comes exception.

Thier occured an error or blaahh... blaahh.. blaahh...
don't have a permission to access the .../../../laravel.log file.

for that change the xampp htdocs root.
In this i have guided to how to start HTDOcs assuming you are knowing the basic things.
If have any question ask me..
