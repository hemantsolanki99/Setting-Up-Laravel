First create a new folder named websites or any desired name at your desired storage location.
In my case I am creating it in /home/hemant. hemant is my username
Now your new path will be /home/hemant/websites



1. First of all go to the /opt/lampp/etc
   Change the Document Root from 

DocumentRoot "/opt/lampp/htdocs"
<Directory "/opt/laampp/htdocs">

  to 

DocumentRoot "/home/hemant/websites"
<Directory "/home/hemant/websites">

and save it.


2. Now go to your new folder websites
  open terminal here.

Now in terminal write code 

composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel cms(your project folder name)
  here cms is the project folder name change it with your desired project name
